          <h2>Interpretation/Translation</h2>
          <p>For organizations or individuals who would rather someone else handle the details of communicating in one of our target languages, PEP offers uncertified interpretation and translation. This option is best for non-legally binding engagements where information gathering is the main goal of conversation or correspondence.</p>

          <h2>Instruction</h2>
          <p>Traditional high school and adult foreign language education presents language in a vacuum, as if it existed on in grammar books and artificially simulated conversations. Whether you're a student who needs extra help understanding difficult language concepts or an adult who always thought you were "not good at languages" or "too old" to learn one, let PEP show you how to tap into your natural language learning ability to acquire your second (and perhaps, third!) language. </p>

          <h2>On Call Language Support</h2>
          <p>If you need to have someone you can trust and call on for language needs at any time, day or night, 24/7/365, PEP provides on call language support for both translation and interpretation needs. This is the perfect solution for an business or government entity with tight deadlines and recurring need.</p>

          <p class="lead">Traditional language learning methodologies don't take into account two very important principles in second language learning: active participation and immersive instruction. Using the exact same methodology with which the State Department brings its diplomats from zero language ability to full fluency in as little as six months* combined with techniques learned from trial and error in learning ten language, PEP adapts its instruction to the needs of the organization or individual and provides an active and immersive environment in which language skills are expanded and strengthened. </p>
          <p class="small">* Results vary by language and are based on full time 40 hour a week study.</p>
